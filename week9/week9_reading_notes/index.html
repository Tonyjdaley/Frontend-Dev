                        Window Objects are objects that tranlate or communicate with the browser itself, <br>
                        this can involve browser history, cookies, etc. they act like global varables for <br>
                        your browser

                        BOM’s or browser object model is the model type for our object communicating with <br>
                        the browser, this model encompasses how to correctly create objects that can respond <br>
                        to information provided by the browser.

                        Html5 is currently the latest version of Hyper Markup Text Language, it adds many <br>
                        more features, tags, and elements that can’t be found in html, including replacing a <br>
                        few with more functional and appropriate tags. the main difference between the two is <br>
                        that html5 has more capablities in manipulating sound files and videos

                            this week i gained lots of input on how html5 works and why it is important, it is also <br>
                            important to note the BOM that directly helps us utilize browser information.
