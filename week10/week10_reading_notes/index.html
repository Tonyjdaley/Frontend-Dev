                <p> 
                    Web API or Application Program Interface is a type of program that has data or information stored that <br>
                    can be interacted with to be used for your sites on purposes. These interfaces are developed by a third <br>
                    party and often involve large corporations who must use large amounts of information in a certain format, <br>
                    with the format changing. Here are two ways we interact with api’s
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        First, we have client-side form validation. In this instance we have an information field that we can <br>
                        fill out, if the information field doesn’t match up. Then we receive an error message. This is useful <br>
                        because it allows us to interact with the api and pull only information that is valid not information <br>
                        that is in valid.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Next we also have fetch key word, this allows us to pull information from different Api’s sources then <br>
                        use them to fill out our page with data coming from them. these are very useful when we have a large <br>
                        database meant for storing information that we want to grab in a organized format.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                        <p>
                            All in all, the role of API’s are very important, they make it so we don’t have to constantly <br>
                            update many different website we are using, we only need to make sure the api we are pulling from <br>
                            is functioning correctly. And then only the api itself needs to be updated. Let’s say you have 20 <br>
                            different index.html pages. Instead of having to go through change every single on of those pages. <br>
                            All you need to do is make sure the api is up to date and working.
                        </p>
