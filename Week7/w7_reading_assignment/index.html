                <p> 
                    This week we went into further understanding of functions, and we are learning <br>
                    about what ajax files are. In truth I feel as though I wasn’t quite able to dig <br>
                    much deeper with functions, they are just such a large topic. That it is still hard <br>
                    for me to gather complete their depth and capabilities. Ajax however is very interesting <br>
                    they are a form of file pathing it seems that allows background information to continue <br>
                    running
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        First off is Functions, as already known, function I see has the brain of our <br>
                        applications, they are what makes it think and process. That being said we continue <br>
                        to learn about the scope of what we can really accomplish with these functions. In <br>
                        truth its hard to name all the capabilities, but one that I liked and ill share is <br>
                        a promise it is a type of function that represents a future result, these are <br>
                        interesting to me because unlike most function they don’t create a immediate response, <br>
                        it is not necessarily a delayed response either. It is more something that will occur <br>
                        once the parameters are matched. This is cool because it allows you to attach multiple <br>
                        function onto a function and when parameters are met they begin to rise in scale.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ajax is very intriguing since it Is a way to make a web page not static, allowing for <br>
                        background information. This is revolutionary since being able to do it will allow <br>
                        updates on a site without actually having to reset it. An example of this might be a <br>
                        message board, lets say you message someone and then they message you back. If this page <br>
                        was static, it would then have to be refreshed in order for you to see the message. However, <br>
                        with the ability to update in the background we are essentially making it so it so it is always <br>
                        active and able to change as you make changes. This in itself is huge!
                    </li>
                </ol>
                    <br>
                        <p>
                            To conclude once gain I need to continue to search more into functions and understand <br>
                            them better, they really do just have an incredible number of things they can accomplish, <br>
                            and I need to be able to see some of the abilities they have, its like understanding plus <br>
                            and minus, but needing to understand multiplication and division to help make things more <br>
                            efficient.
