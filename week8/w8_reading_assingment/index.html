            <h2>week08-notes and reading</h2>
                <p> 
                    This week’s reading was spent learning how to alter elements in different ways using JS.<br> 
                    It also gave us understanding on how to pull arrays or information from other sources using <br>
                    json files. Finally we learned a little bit about different types of API or formatting methods <br>
                    that help increase quality of source images and such.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Transforms, a are a more advance set of CSS rules (CSS3 that allow us greater control of <br>
                        the page elements.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Transition is a type of CSS3 rule that allows us gradually to change from on state to <br>
                        another. For example, a hover effect instead of being immediate we can make the effect drawn <br>
                        out and slower in its change
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Animation is like Transition but use a frame state and moves between them to create a moving <br>
                        image or process.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Json files are place holder files that can be easily translated or converted over the web <br>
                        and used in our applications.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Canvas API is a flexible Application Programming interface that allows us to create any type <br>
                        of visual effect we can think of all through JS
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        SVG or Scalable Vector Graphics, is a file format type that allows us to scale imagery and other <br>
                        type of visuals in our application with out losing Quality of the image itself. This is done <br>
                        using XML files
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        XML files are a type of file format that allows easy transfer over the wire and become assets <br>
                        that can be used over the web.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                    <br>
                        <p>
                            All in all, this week had some really good insight, and we went pretty deep into how to use <br>
                            resources, elements, assets, and such, that are not located in our index.html’s folders but <br>
                            instead located across the wire in various location as needed. We then looked at different ways <br>
                            to alter these data sets and how to obtain greater control over what these resources can do.
                        </p>
